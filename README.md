# Analyzing Online Social Networks through Search Engine Data

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize online social networks based on publicly available data from search engine results. By leveraging web scraping techniques and the SERPAPI (Search Engine Results Page API), the project gathers information about relationships between websites and topics of interest. The collected data is used to construct a network graph using NetworkX and visualize network properties using heatmaps and 3D mesh models.

## Project Components
- **Web Scraping with SERPAPI:** Implement web scraping to extract data from search engine results pages.
- **Network Construction with NetworkX:** Utilize NetworkX to build a graph representing the relationships between websites and topics.
- **Network Analysis:** Perform basic network analysis to identify key nodes based on centrality measures.
- **Heatmap Visualization:** Use heatmap visualization techniques to depict the strength of relationships between nodes.
- **3D Mesh Modeling:** Implement 3D mesh modeling to visualize the network graph in a three-dimensional space.
